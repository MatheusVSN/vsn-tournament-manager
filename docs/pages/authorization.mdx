# Authorization

Many of the routes in this API require authorization. This means that you must provide a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request.

The JWT token is obtained when a user logs in, via the [POST `authentication/login`](/routes/authentication/#post-authenticationlogin) route.
The token is returned in the `token` field of the response body.

To provide the token in your request, include it in the `Authorization` header with the format `Bearer {token}`, where `{token}` is the JWT token. For example:

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

If a route requires authorization and you do not provide a valid token, or if the token does not grant you permission to perform the requested operation, the API will return a 401 Unauthorized.
