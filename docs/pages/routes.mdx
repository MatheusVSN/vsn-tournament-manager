# Routes

The application provides several API endpoints, or "routes", that clients can use to interact with the application.
Each route corresponds to a specific operation that can be performed, such as retrieving data, creating new data, updating existing data, or deleting data.
Clients can send HTTP requests to these routes to perform these operations.
The method of the HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) determines the type of operation to be performed.
In the following sections, each route is documented in detail, including its method, URL, request parameters, request body, response and possible errors.

Please note that any route can potentially return a 500 Internal Server Error status code if an unexpected error occurs on the server.
In such cases, the response body will typically contain a message indicating that an error occurred:

```json
{
  "message": "string"
}
```

**All errors returns the same body structure as above**

  Some routes are nested under other routes. 
  They use the route name and id from the parent route.
  
  For example:

Let's say you want to perform a operation on a league.
If you observe, you will see that the league route is nested under the tournaments route:

![Nested route example](../images/NestedRouteExample.png)

To perform a PUT call on the league, you will use the following route:

`/tournaments/<tournament_id>/leagues/<league_id>`

If you want to perform a POST call:

`/tournaments/<tournament_id>/leagues`

</Callout>
