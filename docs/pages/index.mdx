# VSN-Tournament Manager

VSN-Tournament Manager is an application to facilitate your tournament organization.
You can create tournaments and each tournament can have multiple leagues/divisions

## Motivation

This project was born out of my passion for football and its statistics.
I wanted to experiment new technologies when building applications, and given my interests in football,
I decided to create an application that could combine these two passions.
The main purpose of VSN-Tournament Manager is to make organizing tournament in an efficient and easy manner.

## Technologies used

- ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

Rust is a powerful language that combines safety and performance.
Together with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework,
it allows the application to focus on delivering high performance while maintaining safety

- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

MySQL is a well-known relational database. It has been used to organize data in a structured and organized way

## Configuring the project

<Steps>

### Step 1

Before running the project, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo: Cargo comes with Rust if you installed it from the official website
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

### Step 2

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatheusVSN/vsn-tournament-manager.git
cd vsn-tournament-manager
```

### Step 3

Inside the project, there is a folder named `database` which contains a file named `main.sql`.
You need to execute this file in your MySQL to set up the database for the project.
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal (replace yourusername and yourpassword with your MySQL username and password):

```bash
mysql -u yourusername -p yourpassword < database/main.sql
```

### Step 4

Please note that you may need to configure your MySQL database connection in a .env file in the root of your project.
Refer to the `.env.example` file in the repository for an example of how to set this up.

### Step 5

After setting up the database and the enviroments variables, you can build and run the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

</Steps>
